# Py_OOP_ML_Sunday_Doodlings
I had a bit of free time, so I...

- Explored OOP in Python
- Tried to find the most accurate version of a Linear Regression Model
- Dumped (saved) the Model
- Loaded said Model
- Seeded data for testing the Model

Do drop me a comment on how it can be improved. Cheers!
